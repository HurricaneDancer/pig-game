<h1>Pig Game</h1>

<p>
Pig Game is a game which is part of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>'s JavaScript course on Udemy. This is my implementation of the game

In this game, you can roll the dice. If you are happy with your score, you click "Hold" and it will add your current score to your total score and then switch player. However, if you roll a one your score is reset and the player is switched.

When you click "New Game" the scores and screen is reset.

The point of this lesson was DOM manipulation </br>
